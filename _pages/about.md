I am an incoming master’s student in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University. I obtained my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2023, and my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics (with a minor in Economics) from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2022.

During my master’s studies, I worked with [**Prof. Min Xu**](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) on 4D reconstruction and anomaly detection systems. I also joined the CCVL Lab at Johns Hopkins University, working with [**Prof. Alan Yuille**](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks and synthetic dataset generation. My current research interests lie in embodied AI with spatiotemporal intelligence and physically plausible reconstruction.  

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on ethical AI and decision-making with [**Prof. Lirong Xia**](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~lirong.xia/).
