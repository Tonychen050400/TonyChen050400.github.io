I am an incoming masterâ€™s student in Computational Science and Engineer at Harvard University. I obtained my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2023, and my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics (minor in Economics) from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2022.

During my master studies, I worked with Prof. Min Xu on 4D reconstruction, and anomaly detection systems, and with Prof. Alan Yuille on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks and synthetic dataset generation. My current research interests lie in embodied AI with spatial-temporal intelligence and physical plausible reconstruction.
